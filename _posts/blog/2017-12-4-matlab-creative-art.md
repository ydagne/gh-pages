While working with complex I/Q data captured from radio signals, some of the graphic plots ended up being pieces of art work by accident. So, it might be worth sharing it with you. Matlab is a powerful software that is used in various fields such as engineering, mathematics, economics, automation systems. It has a rich set of libraries for signal processing and data visualization. Though Matlabâ€™s graphics engine is not meant for high quality artwork, it is fun to play with it. The script is available on [github](https://github.com/ydagne/Matlab-CreativeArt).

Here are sample outputs.

If you are serious artist, however, I recommend you to check other softwares such as [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/) which are platforms for professional creative artwork design.
